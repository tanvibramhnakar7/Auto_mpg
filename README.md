Auto MPG Prediction App:
This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) of a car based on its features.
The prediction is powered by a machine learning model trained on the Auto MPG dataset.

Features:
Simple and user-friendly web interface
Takes horsepower, weight, and acceleration as input
Uses a pre-trained machine learning model (.pkl file)
Instantly displays MPG prediction
Easy to deploy on Streamlit Cloud / local machine

Model Details:
The model is trained using the Auto MPG dataset.
It takes the following 3 features as input:

Feature	Description:
horsepower	Engine horsepower rating
weight	Weight of the car in pounds
acceleration	Time taken to accelerate from 0–60 mph

Output: Predicted MPG (Miles Per Gallon)

App Interface:
The user enters:
Horsepower
Weight
Acceleration
Then clicks Predict, and the app displays the MPG value.
